## Working process of machine learning project

### Key steps for machine learning projects

1. Collect data
2. Training model
-This many times until the effect is sufficient
3. Deployment model
-Ear data
-D maintenance/update model

practice:

Self -driving car

1. Collect data --- Image, location information of other vehicles
2. Training model
-This many times until the effect is sufficient
3. Deployment model
-Cap data ——— Get new model information
-D maintenance/update model

## Workflow of the data science project

### key steps for data science project

1. Collect data
2. Analysis data
-End up to obtain better insights many times
3. Put forward assumptions/action
-Cleway changes
-E analyzing new data cyclical re -analysis

Data Science vs Machine Learning

| Features | Data Science | Machine Learning |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
| Sales | Optimized Sales Channel | Automatic List Sort |
| Production Line Management Manager | Optimize Production Line | Automatic Visual Detection (defect) |
| Recruitment | Optimize recruitment channels | Automatic screening resume |
| Market | A/B TEST (Collection of different versions of data) | Customized product recommendation |
| Agriculture | Output Analysis | Precision Weeding |


Data science: data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, decision support

Machine learning: Supervision and learning, non -supervision learning, strengthening learning, semi -supervision learning, self -supervision learning

Data science is a wider concept. It will use some machine learning methods to solve complex data problems


## How to choose an artificial intelligence project

### AI knowledge and field knowledge

Brainstorm

-The task automation is more important than replacing jobs?
-In the task of being able to use machine learning to use machine learning in the work process to automate the task.
-What is the main factors to drive business value?
-What is the main pain points in the company's business?
-Even if there is no large amount of data, you can get progress. **
* There is almost no harm to having more data.
* Data make some businesses (such as online search) standing.
* But you can still make progress for small data sets.

### Project due diligence

Technical survey

-Ai system can meet technical requirements (voice recognition rate 95%, etc.)
-The amount of data required
-Engineering planning time

Business investigation

-Re reduce costs
-Cap income
-The new products and business

Moral inspection

-What can be done, what can be done
-Writing things that are beneficial to society, not focusing on Make Money

### Build or Buy

-ML projects can usually be developed or outsourced internally
-DS project is more internal development
-The business standards (industry solutions), better to buy instead of setting up yourself

## cooperation with artificial intelligence team

-Cer clarification of the standard of acceptance

AI Team

Training set test set
Learn (development and verification set)
A-> b

Hope 100%accuracy is impossible

-ML's restrictions
-Sto data
-Pleral data
-The label is unknown or wrong

# The technical tool of the artificial intelligence team

-ML framework
-Tensor Flow, Py Torch, KE RAS, CA distribute E
-The research and release
-AR West V
-Pascular products
-Github

* CPU central processing unit
* GPU image processing unit
*Cloud / On-Premises ** Cloud deployment and localized deployment **
*** EDGE marginal deployment ** (processing data placed to collect data, quickly process data and make decisions, smart driving)
* Edge calculation: speed up the reaction time of the system
