## machine learning

Machine learning mainly includes the following categories:

* Supervised Learning
* Use known input and output to train the model to predict the new unknown data.
* Common task types include classification and regression.
* Non -Supervisor Learning
* Using labelless data, the purpose is to find the structure or mode inside the data.
* Typical tasks include clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, etc.
* Reinforcement Learning
* Let an agent learn decision -making rules through interaction with the environment.The agent will adjust its behavior based on the reward or punishment of environmental feedback to get the largest accumulation reward in the future.
* Application scenarios include games, robot control, resource scheduling and other fields.
* Semi-Supervised Learning:
* Semi -supervision learning between supervision and learning and non -supervision learning.It uses a small amount of label data and a large amount of labelless data to learn to improve the performance of the model.
*This method is very useful when the label is difficult to get or cost high.**
* Self-Supervised Learning:
* Self-supervision learning is a specific type of unsupervised learning. It guides model learning by constructing pseudo-labels.This method is usually used for pre -training stages, and the model learns useful representation without manual labeling.
*This technology is often used for ** visual, voice and natural language processing tasks **.

### Supervision learning

## What is data

Get data

* Manual label
* Observe user behavior
* Download from the website/partner download

Harm of dirty data:

* Garbage in, Garbage Out data
* Data question
* Error label
* Lack of missing values
* Various types of data
* Images, audio, text (regulatory processing)

## aI term

## What can machine learning do and what can not do

** Understand what AI can do and cannot do ** ---> very important

Things that cannot be done: AI do market research, and give 50 pages of analysis reports

Autonomous car: You can recognize the vehicle ahead, and you cannot recognize the different gesture meaning of everyone

### The advantages and disadvantages of machine learning

1. Simple concept
2. A lot of reliable data

ml Cannot Dowel Lin

1. Learn complex concepts from a small amount of data
2. Use the new type of data that have never been seen by the system to perform tasks
