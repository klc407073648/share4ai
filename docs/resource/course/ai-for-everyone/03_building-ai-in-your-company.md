Enter: "Hello, Xiao Ai classmate, play Jay Chou's rice incense"

Execution step (AI PIPELINE):

-D trigger prompt detection
* Audio (Little Ai Smart Assistant) -> Hello, Xiao Ai classmate
-Ouk recognition
* Audio (Little Ai Smart Assistant) -> Play Jay Chou Daoxiang
-In intent to identify
* Focus on Playing Music-> Music Player
-E execution task
* Play Daoxiang

# Example Role so fan ai team

## artificial intelligence team's example role

-Software engineer
-P. For example, realize the reliability of music playback and autonomous driving
-Mee learning engineer
-Chit the software for generating the mapping of A -> B
-Mee learning researcher
-Inderate technology responsible for developing machine learning
-Che application machine learning scientist
-Data scientist
-D monitoring data and analyzing the meaning behind it
-Chang the insights obtained by data analysis help drive business decisions
-Data engineer
-Ogly organization data
-In ensure that data is easy to read and store, and ensure that a very safe, economical and efficient way
-AI product manager
-On help to judge what is feasible and valuable

## Getting Start with a Small Team

-1 Software Engineer, OR
-1 Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist, OR
-Nobody But your set

## artificial intelligence transformation plan

AI transformation manual step:

1. Execute the pilot project to gain momentum or advantage
- ** The success of the start -up project is more important than commercial value **, and can gradually turn other teams to AI
-Insusted projects that can show results in 6-12 months
-The internal and external projects can
2. Build an internal AI team
- ** AI team empowers other departments **
3. Provide extensive AI training
-Executive
* Know what AI can bring to enterprises;
* AI strategy;
* Resource allocation (GPU card, computing resources, etc.)
-AI project leader
* Develop project direction (technical and business survey);
* Resource allocation in the department
* Supervise the process of AI project
-AI engineer
* Build AI software;
* Collect data;
* Execute specific AI tasks
4. Develop AI strategy
- ** Use AI to create an advantage specific to your industry **
-C design a corporate strategy consistent with AI's virtuous cycle
-In consider creating data strategies
-This data acquisition --- free service (Alibaba Cloud, Chatgpt, AI Q & A, etc.)
-Cunge a unified data warehouse — uniform database to facilitate analysis of problems in the production process
-Colon the advantages of network effects and platform
-The winner (Didi, connecting the driver and passengers together)
5. Carry out internal and external exchanges
-The relationship between investors
-The government relationship
-Cian/user training
-Ai talent recruitment
-Chide communication

## The artificial intelligence trap to be avoided

-Don't expect AI to solve everything
* Recognize what AI can do and cannot do, consider the restrictions of technology, data and engineering resources
-Inde rely on a minority machine learning engineer to provide the company with use cases
* Let engineers communicate with business talents, and let them work across the job to find feasible and valuable projects
- ** Don't expect the AI ​​project to succeed once **
*AI development is usually a ** iteration process **, and it takes many times to achieve success
-Don't expect the traditional planning process to apply without changing
* Cooperate with the AI ​​team to establish meaningful time estimates, milestones, KPI or indicators, etc.
-Don't think that the super powerful AI engineer can start a project
* Continue to build a team and cooperate with the team

## TAKING Someone FIRST step in AI

* Get Friends to Learn About AI
-THIS COURSE
-Rading Group
* Start BrainStorming Projects
-no project is too small
* Hire a Few ml/ds people to help
* Hire or app to press AI Leader (VP AI, CAI O, ETC.)
* discus with CEO/BOARD POSSIBILIES of AI Transformation
-Will someone is company be more value and/or more effective
if it was good, TAI?

#P. Survey in the field of artificial intelligence application

## Computer vision

-I image classification/object recognition
-On facial recognition
-Pets detection
-I image segmentation
-Sito/tracking

## Natural language processing

-Staking text classification
-Eo emotional recognition
-Add information retrieval
-WEB search
-Name entity recognition
-On the name of the person, place name, etc.
-Maine translation
-Chritong and English translation
-E Analysis and Voice Partial Label
-The nouns, prepositions, limited words, etc. in sentences

## voice

-Ouk recognition
-Punge to text
-The reminder word detection
-PPR ID
-Puct synthesis
-S text to voice, TTS

## Robot field

Example

- predict
-Stin environmental testing
-Storton planning
-Find the path
- control
-Prip instructions run in accordance with the prescribed path

## 机 machine learning

-The non -structural data

# Main artificial intelligence technology survey

** Non -supervision learning **

-Cacon algorithm
-Enter -input -no -label data, output interesting conclusions
-Grial learning

** Supervision learning **
  
* (Learn from the mapping from input A to output B), the most valuable technology at this stage
* For example, cup pictures (good and bad), build AI applications to complete the 95%good product ratio cup detection

** Strengthening learning **

Use the reward signal to tell that the AI ​​is done well or bad, AI will automatically learn to obtain maximization rewards

Disadvantages: require a lot of data

** Migration learning ---

-On learning task A, help mission B according to previous knowledge B B
* Trained a vehicle detection model. For the new golf model, there are the same wheels and running trajectory detection methods.

** Generate confrontation network **

** Knowledge map **
