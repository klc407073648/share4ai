# Deep Learning (Deep Learning)

## definition

Deep learning is a sub -field of machine learning. It focuses on characteristic learning and pattern recognition through multi -layered artificial neural networks (Ann), especially when processing large -scale data.

## technology

- ** convolutional neural network (CNN) **: widely used in image processing and computer visual tasks, and extract image features through convolution operations.
- ** Circular neural network (RNN) **: Suitable for processing sequence data, such as voice recognition and natural language processing (NLP).Its variants such as long -term memory network (LSTM) better solve the problem of disappearance of the gradient of traditional RNN.
- ** Memory Network (LSTM) **: A special RNN that can effectively handle the problem of length dependencies.
- ** Generate a model of the confrontation network (GAN) **: a model composed of a generator and a device, which is used to generate fake data similar to real data, and is widely used in tasks such as image generation and style conversion.

## application

- ** Autonomous driving **: Use CNN to perform real -time image recognition and processing.
- ** Voice recognition: Voice recognition of virtual assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant.
- ** Image generation and repair **: such as image repair, style migration, and deeper falsification.
