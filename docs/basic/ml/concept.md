# Machine Learning

## definition

Machine learning is a sub -domain of artificial intelligence. It is committed to studying how to drive through data -driven methods so that computers can automatically learn and improve their performance from experience.

## technology

- ** Supervision Learning **: By labeling the data training model, it can predict or classify the new and unsigned data.Common algorithms include: linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, etc.
- ** Unsupervised learning **: Data without labels, the model attempts to find the potential structure or law from the data.Common algorithms include: K average cluster, main component analysis (PCA), etc.
- ** Semi -supervised learning **: Combined with supervision and learning and unsupervised learning. Some data are labeled, and other data are not labeled.
- ** Strengthen learning **: Through interaction with the environment, learn how to maximize long -term returns through action.

## application

- ** Recommended system **: For example, personalized recommendations for Netflix and Amazon.
- ** Spam Test **: Based on historical data training classifiers, identify spam.
- ** Financial forecast **: If the stock market forecast and credit score system.
