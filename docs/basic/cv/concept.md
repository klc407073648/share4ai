# Computer vision (Computer Vision)

## definition

Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence, which aims to enable computers to understand and explain the visual world by analyzing images and videos.

## technology

- ** image classification **: allocate images into a category, and use deep learning models such as CNN for training.
- ** Target detection **: Identify the location and category of multiple objects in the image. The commonly used algorithms include YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and so on.
- ** Image segmentation **: Divide images into several areas, and accurately separates different objects in images, such as U-Net for medical image segmentation.
- ** Gesture estimation **: It is estimated that the position and orientation of the human body or object in the space.

## application

- ** Autonomous driving **: Through computer vision recognition road signs, pedestrians and obstacles.
- ** Face recognition **: For applications in mobile phones unlocking or security monitoring.
- ** Medicine image **: Automated diagnosis of diseases, especially in X -ray, CT and MRI image analysis.
- ** Safety monitoring **: Face recognition, abnormal behavior detection, etc.
- ** Augmented reality **: The integration of virtual objects and real world.
