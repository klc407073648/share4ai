## definition

Natural language processing is a cross discipline in the field of computer science, artificial intelligence and linguistics, and aims to enable computers to understand, generate and handle human language.

## technology

- ** Text pre -processing **: such as segmentation, decentralization words, and sebulsum.
- ** Word Embedding **: Convert the words to high -dimensional vectors, such as Word2vec, Glove, etc.————— the Embedding model is part of natural language processing
- ** Transformer model **: For example, BERT, GPT series, etc. Based on the self-teasing mechanism, major breakthroughs have been achieved on many NLP tasks.
- ** Naming entity recognition (NER) **: identify entities such as names, place names, and organization names from the text.
- ** Emotional Analysis **: Analyze the emotional tendency of text, and is widely used in social media monitoring and market research.
- ** Machine Translation **: Translate one natural language into another natural language.

- ** Voice recognition **: Convert voice to text, such as voice assistant.
- ** Chat robot **: NLP -based chat system, such as customer service robots.
