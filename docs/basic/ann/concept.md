# Artificial neural network

## definition

Artificial neural network is a computing model that simulates the structure of the biological nervous system, which aims to simulate the information processing process of the human brain through multi -layer nodes (neurons).

## technology

- ** Perceptron **: The most basic neural network contains the input layer and output layer for linear classification.
- ** Multi -layer perception machine (MLP) **: It consists of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers to train through reverse communication algorithms.
- ** Reverse communication algorithm **: Optimizing neural network weights through gradient decrease method is the core algorithm of training deep neural networks.
- ** Activated function **: such as RELU, SIGMOID, TANH, etc., used to introduce non -linear characteristics.

## application

- ** voice recognition and generation **: such as automatic voice recognition (ASR) and voice synthesis (TTS).
- ** Image classification and generation **: such as image recognition, style migration, etc.
- ** Recommended system **: For example, personalized recommendations for movies and products.
- ** Natural language processing **: emotional analysis, machine translation, etc.
