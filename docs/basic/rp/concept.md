# Reinforcement lead

## definition

Strengthening learning is a method of learning. Through the trial and error and reward mechanism, let the smart (Agent) learn how to make decisions from the environment to achieve long -term goals.

## technology

- ** q Learning **: One value iteration method, to guide the smart body decision -making by updating the Q value.
- ** Deep q network (DQN) **: Combined with deep learning and Q learning, use deep neural networks to estimate the Q value function.
- ** Strategic gradient method **: Direct optimization strategy function, such as Reinforce algorithm.
- ** Multi -arm slot machine problem **: The problem of weighing and utilization between exploration and utilization is widely used in strengthening learning.

## application

- ** Game AI **: For example, AlphaGo defeats the world Go champion by strengthening learning.
- ** Robot control **: Through learning different action strategies to achieve complex tasks.
- ** Financial transaction **: Automation trading system optimizes trading strategies by strengthening learning.
- ** Resource management **: Energy scheduling, inventory management, etc.
