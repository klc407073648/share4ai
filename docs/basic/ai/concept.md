# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## definition

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to simulation, extension, and expansion of human intelligence technology. It aims to enable computer systems to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence to complete, such as understanding language, identification images, reasoning and decision -making.

## history

- ** 1950 **: The origin of AI can be traced back to 1950. Allen Turing proposed "Turing Test", which is the standard for testing the machine to have human intelligence.
- ** 1956 **: John McCarthy and others formally proposed the term "artificial intelligence" at the Datmouth conference, marking the birth of AI as a discipline.
- ** 1960-1970 **: The early AI research concentrated on the reasoning system based on symbolic logic and rules.
- ** 1980-1990: The rise of expert systems, as well as the preliminary development of machine learning and neural networks.
- ** 21st century **: With the advancement of computing power, data volume, and algorithms, and the breakthroughs of deep learning technologies have entered the stage of rapid development, widely used in the fields of voice recognition, image processing.
